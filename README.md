# Coffee Shop Full Stack

This is a new digitally enabled cafe established by Udacity for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard . In this project we demonstrated our skills to create a full stack drink menu application.

The application:

1. Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
